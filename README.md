**A curated corpus of real-world security incidents, attack techniques, CVEs, frameworks, and defensive tools for autonomous AI agents.**

*From zero-click Copilot exfiltration to AI-powered C2 channels — attacks on agentic AI have moved well beyond theory.*

> Incidents like these raise a harder question for teams shipping AI-generated code: *do you actually know what your agent did?* We are building **[h5i](https://github.com/Koukyosyumei/h5i)** to answer it — a Git sidecar that records every prompt, decision, and uncertainty signal alongside the diff, so you can audit what the AI touched, catch credential leaks before they land, and resume sessions without losing context.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Security

### MCP Incidents & PoCs

| Incident | Description | Reference |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **GitHub MCP Prompt Injection** | Malicious instructions in GitHub Issues hijacked agents connected via the GitHub MCP server; private repo contents and API keys exfiltrated. | [Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) |
| **WhatsApp MCP Chat History Exfiltration** | Invariant Labs PoC: a malicious server combined tool poisoning with the legitimate `whatsapp-mcp` server to silently exfiltrate an entire chat history—zero user interaction. | [Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks) |
| **MCP Inspector RCE** | Anthropic's own MCP Inspector developer tool allowed unauthenticated RCE via its inspector–proxy architecture, turning a debugging aid into a remote shell. | [AuthZed Timeline](https://authzed.com/blog/timeline-mcp-breaches) |
| **mcp-remote OAuth Command Injection** `CVE-2025-6514` | Critical OS command injection in the most widely used OAuth proxy for connecting local MCP clients to remote servers. | [AuthZed Timeline](https://authzed.com/blog/timeline-mcp-breaches) |
| **Smithery Build Config Path Traversal** | A path-traversal vulnerability in Smithery's build configuration leaked a builder's `~/.docker/config.json`, exposing a Fly.io API token that granted control over 3,000+ deployed apps. | [AuthZed Timeline](https://authzed.com/blog/timeline-mcp-breaches) |

### MCP Attack Vectors

| Vector | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tool Poisoning** | Malicious instructions embedded in MCP tool `description` or `inputSchema` fields—invisible to users but parsed and executed by LLMs. The attack triggers *before* the poisoned tool is ever called. |
| **Rug Pull / Silent Redefinition** | MCP tools mutate their own definitions after installation and approval; the tool you approved is not the tool that executes. |
| **Tool Shadowing** | A malicious server injects a tool description that overrides or modifies the agent's behavior with respect to a different, trusted server's tools. |
| **Cross-Server Manipulation** | With multiple MCP servers connected, a malicious one intercepts and replaces calls destined for a trusted one—invisible to the user. |
| **Tool Return Attacks** | Malicious instructions injected into tool *output* (not descriptions), exploiting the same data/instruction confusion in the model's context. Effective even with hex-encoded payloads. |
| **MCP Preference Manipulation (MPMA)** | Subtly alter how AI agents rank and select among available tools, steering them toward attacker-controlled options. |
| **Webpage Poison via MCP Browser Tool** | Any MCP tool that fetches web content becomes a vector for indirect prompt injection from attacker-controlled pages. |

> **Root cause**: MCP clients receive tool metadata via `tools/list`, pass it into the LLM context without sanitization, and the LLM treats natural-language descriptions as instructions. The vulnerability is entirely client-side. ([arXiv 2603.22489](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.22489))

## Attack Taxonomy

### The Promptware Kill Chain

Prompt injection has evolved from an isolated input-manipulation exploit into a structured, multi-stage malware mechanism. Analysis of 36 prominent incidents found at least 21 attacks traversing four or more stages of this kill chain. ([arXiv 2601.09625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09625))

```
Stage 1: Initial Access        ──► Prompt injection (direct or indirect)
Stage 2: Privilege Escalation  ──► Jailbreak system constraints / safety filters
Stage 3: Reconnaissance        ──► Probe agent memory, tools, environment config
Stage 4: Persistence           ──► Poison agent long-term memory / RAG database
Stage 5: Command & Control     ──► Establish external channel (e.g., SesameOp)
Stage 6: Lateral Movement      ──► Leverage agent permissions to infect other agents
Stage 7: Actions on Objective  ──► Data exfiltration / financial fraud / system disruption
```

### Attack Techniques

| Technique | Category | Key Property |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Direct Prompt Injection** | Input Manipulation | Malicious instructions in user turn override system prompt |
| **Indirect Prompt Injection (XPIA)** | Input Manipulation | Instructions hidden in emails, web pages, documents, tool output |
| **Tool Poisoning** | MCP / Supply Chain | Malicious content in tool metadata—triggers before tool is called |
| **Tool Shadowing** | MCP | Malicious server overrides trusted tool behavior |
| **Rug Pull / Silent Redefinition** | MCP | Tool definitions mutate post-installation |
| **Cross-Server Manipulation** | MCP | Malicious server intercepts calls to trusted server |
| **Memory Poisoning** | Persistence | Gradually corrupt agent long-term memory over multiple sessions |
| **RAG / Knowledge Base Poisoning** | Persistence | Inject malicious documents into retrieval corpus; 5 docs can achieve 90% manipulation rate |
| **Agent Session Smuggling** | Multi-Agent | Exploit A2A protocol trust across multi-turn conversations |
| **Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)** | Multi-Agent | Compromised agent manipulates inter-agent message flow |
| **Infectious Prompt Propagation** | Multi-Agent | Malicious instructions spread virally across agent networks |
| **Backdoor Attacks** | Model-Level | Trained-in triggers cause malicious behavior on specific inputs |
| **AI Agent Clickbait** `AML.T0100` | Agentic UI | Manipulate web UI to lure agentic browsers into unintended actions |
| **Tool Call Injection** | Execution | Poisoned context causes agent to invoke tools with malicious parameters |
| **PLeak** | Info Extraction | Algorithmic extraction of system prompts via black-box queries |
| **Steganographic C2** | Covert Channel | Encode commands in LLM-generated content; agents communicate covertly |
| **Invisible Prompt Injection** | Stealth | Zero-width characters, Unicode homoglyphs, or control characters hide payloads |
| **Living-off-the-Land AI (LotAI)** | Stealth | Abuse legitimate AI service APIs (e.g., OpenAI Assistants) for C2, blending into normal traffic |

## Frameworks & Standards

### OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (ASI 2026)

Released December 2025. Developed with 100+ security researchers. Distinct from the general LLM Top 10—focuses on the failure of *agentic* properties: autonomy, persistence, and tool integration.

| Rank | ID | Risk | Core Failure Mode |
|------|----|------|-------------------|
| 1 | ASI01 | **Agent Goal Hijack** | Attackers redirect agent goals and task selection via prompt injection, forged messages, or poisoned external data — exploiting LLMs' inherent inability to distinguish instructions from content |
| 2 | ASI02 | **Tool Misuse & Exploitation** | Agents misuse legitimate tools through unsafe composition, prompt injection into tool calls, or over-privileged access — leading to data exfiltration, destructive actions, or DoS |
| 3 | ASI03 | **Identity & Privilege Abuse** | Agents inherit excessive credentials or over-scoped API access, enabling privilege escalation or actions beyond intended authorization scope |
| 4 | ASI04 | **Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** | Compromised tool registries, MCP servers, third-party agents, or model artifacts introduce malicious behavior through trusted supply chain channels |
| 5 | ASI05 | **Unexpected Code Execution (RCE)** | Agents execute injected or unintended code via code-execution tools (shell, eval, REPL) due to insufficient sandboxing or input validation |
| 6 | ASI06 | **Memory & Context Poisoning** | Persistent corruption of agent memory, retrieval context, or long-term state biases future behavior without the agent or user detecting the tampering |
| 7 | ASI07 | **Insecure Inter-Agent Communication** | Spoofed or manipulated messages between collaborating agents propagate malicious instructions across a multi-agent system |
| 8 | ASI08 | **Cascading Failures** | Small errors or resource overuse propagate across interconnected agent systems, amplifying into large-scale disruptions |
| 9 | ASI09 | **Human-Agent Trust Exploitation** | Agents produce misleading or overconfident outputs that exploit human tendency to trust AI, causing harmful decisions by operators or end users |
| 10 | ASI10 | **Rogue Agents** | Agents drift from intended behavior due to misalignment, self-modification, or emergent collusion — without active attacker involvement |
